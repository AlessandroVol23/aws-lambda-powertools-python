The feature flags utility provides a simple rule engine to define when one or multiple features should be enabled depending on the input.

!!! tip "For simpler use cases where a feature is simply on or off for all users, use [Parameters](parameters.md) utility instead."

## Key features

* Define simple feature flags to dynamically decide when to enable a feature


## TODO

* Review param names and UX
	- Deep dive on naming - AppConfigFetcher vs ConfigurationStore vs SchemaFetcher
	- How can we make it easier to get started
* Getting started
  	- Sample Infrastructure
  	- Quickest way to start --- defaults, built-ins
* Advanced section
  	- Bring your own
